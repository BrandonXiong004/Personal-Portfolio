                    <br>
                    <p>

                        The sample presented is my very first website I ever developed as a practice project, known as
                        Chronoshift Expeditions. To me, this project is considered as the very first mainframe of my web
                        development and programming pathway, which also piqued my interest further into computers. This
                        project first started off with thorough planning and a structural design process after reading
                        the short story, “A Sound of Thunder”, by Ray Bradbury. Creating various contents, containing
                        subjects such as: a home page, an about page, an expeditions page, a rules page, and a booking
                        page, were essential requirements to arrange the key information and purpose of the website.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        On the other hand, after conducting planning and explanatory detail for the website, I was
                        tasked with creating a wireframe that would serve as a template for the website. The wireframe
                        itself would be of service for when I developed the coding in visual studio code. Using visual
                        studio code, I used HTML5 and CSS3 to design the website basing it off the wireframe I created.
                        As part of the technical aspect as well, I had to ensure my HTML was thoroughly corrected
                        through an HTML validator, making sure my code was valid. However, if I had to say, my biggest
                        challenge on this project was developing media queries. Media queries were extremely crucial, as
                        content on the website needed specific spacing, text alignment, or even content placement. I
                        struggled directly with using flexboxes as I didn’t really have a good grasp of it. I resolved
                        this by teaching myself and informing myself on media queries using youtube lessons as a
                        reference. Additionally, I referred back to media query notes I had written. Finally as a
                        result, I was able to finalize my project. As part of my self-reflection, if I had something to
                        take away from this project, it would be that trying your best and even with a new subject,
                        topic, or what it may be, continue to persist and don’t be afraid to explore or play around with
                        your own creativity. Nonetheless, as one of the CART “Habits of Mind” included, I showcased the
                        investigate, persist, and reflect habits of mind. Lastly, without the support, feedback, and
                        positive criticism from my peers, I would’ve definitely had a more difficult time creating my
                        first website.
