                        The sample presented is an online calculator that I was assigned to complete. The calculator is a simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide only. The calculator was created by using visual studio code to write in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. A requirement for creating the calculator was to incorporate an if-else statement, meaning a loop that will only run if an expression is correct. Additionally, a switch and case statement are required to incorporate the mathematical solution. Within this assignment, I learned how to utilize switch and case statements to make an order of operation calculator for certain conditions. When developing the JavaScript, it was challenging to actually devise how I wanted my conditions to be checked and solved. Apart from that as well, it was really hard to understand how to make the equal actually present the mathematical result. Eventually, I ended up with a working switch and case function which allowed me to correctly use the calculator to solve simple math. However, I ran into the error of my equal symbol not working. Eventually, I ended up solving this by rewriting my code after more than perhaps 5 times, but the solution that worked for me was to use the eval statement. This essentially evaluates strings and values for the switch conditions that are given in the calculator. In reflection on this assignment, I demonstrated CART’s Habit of Minds, Investigate, and Persist. I did this by investigating my own code thoroughly to check how it was working and how I can create a better function and code. For persistence, I kept working even when running into difficulties and challenges. Nonetheless, I’m glad to have been able to create the calculator.
