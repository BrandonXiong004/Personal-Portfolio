                    Welcome to my online digital portfolio! First and foremost, I want to thank you as the viewers for
                    viewing my portfolio. This entire website has been developed and designed by myself, hoping to allow
                    my audience to get to know me and see what kind of person I am.

                Who Am I?
            </h2>
            <p>
                My name is Brandon Xiong, and I am currently nearing the end of the path to graduate from Floyd B
                Buchanan High School, class of 2022, and will be moving on to the next chapter in my life. Concurrently
                as of now, I am also attending the Center of Advanced Research and Technology(CART) as part of the web
                development and application lab, whereas last year from 2020-21, I attended the cybersecurity lab. I am
                insatiably always wanting to learn more about computers and I want to be able to take my time to
                understand the framework and boundaries of where computers can lead us in the future!
                <br>

                As a student in the web application development lab, I utilize various applications used to design
                websites such as Figma, Lucidchart, and Visual Studio Code. In more detail, Figma is a vector graphics
                editor used to design layouts, shapes, text, and coordination of applications, as well as websites
                themselves. On the other hand, Lucidchart is used to design flowcharts, either proposed for the use of
                algorithms, decisions, and network connections. Moreover, Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor,
                mainly used with the intent of developing programs, softwares, and coding information together to either
                exchange, create, restore, or delete data. Cybersecurity on the other hand, I explored the malicious
                attack programs developed by people with the intent of using it for unethical purposes. Additionally, I
                learned how with further experience, we can mostly prevent these attacks from happening by understanding
                the language of how these malicious programs work, and design an encryption algorithm which counter
                these attacks.
                <br>
                <br>
                To illustrate more about my professional work, in the web development lab I have orchestrated and layed out wireframes essential to designing websites made by me. In the lab, there is lots of collaboration between peers working together from time to time usually for assistance to help accomplish individual goals and work. But when it comes to conducting actual designs and websites as a team, I have done my share of always trying my best to accomplish my work and always trying to look out for my team members and accommodating them. As for my cybersecurity lab, I have conducted research based problems along with a mentor in order to derive a solution. These research based problems often accounted for connections of professional work relations in the computer field, computer networking, hardware manufacturing, and computer information systems.
                <br>
                <br>
                On the matter, to describe myself as a person, I have a deep interest in computers such as PC designs, development and code, and cars. I believe that computers are revolutionary and highly innovative. While indeed they are still volatile as they can be, I believe that with the right purpose and intent they can help solve big complex problems that would take decades, if not centuries. Additionally, I am genuinely an avid gamer. I absolutely enjoy my time commonly on my computer playing fantasy games, story games, and action games. However, in my free time as well, I enjoy weight lifting. Weight lifting is not only beneficial for my health, but I enjoy the thrill and pump of muscle stimulation. Nonetheless, in the professional world and outside of it, I enjoy trying to be the best I can be and be helpful and kind to others.
