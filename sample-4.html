                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The sample presented is an interactive story project I created working with a partner. For this
                        particular project, each partner had to work together collectively to create an interactive
                        story based on their own theme, story genre, and creativity. For my project, my partner and I
                        decided on a fictional fantasy story. The story takes place with the main character living in
                        modern-day time, who is transported to another world where the era of swords and magic exists.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In emphasis, the project first began with an outline of requirements and criteria we had to
                        follow. First and foremost, a written project description had to be drafted before any
                        flowcharting and programming could be done. After a final draft of the description, my partner
                        and I began creating a flowchart, mapping out each decision and what output it branches out to.
                        Prior to creating the flowchart, a program logic needed to be programmed in order to give
                        ourselves a base structure of an algorithm that updates the screen or progresses the story. On
                        the daily, personal journal entries had to be completed, task lists had to be updated, and a
                        meeting with our instructor had to be met on a specific deadline to stay updated with our work.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        On the other hand, after the program flowchart was completed, my partner and I began the coding
                        on visual studio code. In visual studio code, we mainly used HTML5 to format the website layout,
                        CSS3 for the visuals such as decoration for the website and background, and lastly JavaScript
                        for our story progression. Additionally, JavaScript was probably the most challenging part of
                        this project. This was because a particular array that held our story content was not being
                        iterated within our story. This was a big problem because, without the contents of the story,
                        the text for the story would not be updated or refreshed in the story section. However, a
                        solution to fix this was by reconfiguring the different indexes of the array and editing the
                        code. An example of this would be using: [array].option, rather than [array].options. The sample
                        letter of an ‘s’ caused us rather inconvenient problems, but once figured out, the story worked
                        just fine. If I had to state what CART Habits of Mind I displayed, it would be the investigate,
                        collaborate, and persist habits of mind. Investigate, because careful analysis of my code had to
                        be observed to resolve errors. Collaboration with my partner was really important and it was a
                        big help to be able to have a partner as well. Lastly, persistence was demonstrated as I stayed
                        motivated to complete the story.
