                        The sample presented is a tourism website project I worked on and developed with a team of four. Furthermore, the context of this project was that we as a team were recruited to design a tourism website targeting 18-29-year-olds. The website would overall present information about the countries, certain destinations or interesting landmarks, and unique tourist points.

                        <br>

                        Moreover, the construction of this project first began by brainstorming and creating select countries all over the world to choose from. To that extent, my team and I decided to choose the Philippines, Lebanon, and Taiwan. Next, my team and I began creating a blueprint wireframe using Figma to design a base structure for the website. From there, we designed the home page, destinations page, and three other pages that would cover the content of each country individually. Once the base structure was drafted, we began detailing and revising the wireframe for a final prototype. Once prototyped, we presented it to our web development lab for feedback and changes. After being given thorough feedback and constructive criticism, my team and I immediately set out to push revision and edits to our wireframe. After successfully having our wireframe approved, my team and I began developing our website in visual studio code. Within visual studio code, my team and I began splitting up the work to each individual country we selected, as our layout would be the same since the wireframe we created had been specifically designed for it. However, I would say that I struggled a lot with trying to code specific images to be in the correct position. I did this by using flexboxes, but I struggled quite a bit with also trying to fix information together with the information. To resolve this issue, I researched w3schools, youtube lessons on media queries, and asked my instructor various questions to help. As a result, through diligent use of my time, I was able to develop the code so that the website would arrange as our wireframe did. In reference to this project, I demonstrated CART’s Habits of Mind, “Initiate”, “Investigate”, and “Collaborate”. This project took a lot of communication and collaboration to push out changes, commits, and code to create the final product we wanted. Nonetheless, I would say this project provided excellent experience in teamwork, collaboration, communication, problem-solving, and web development. If I had the chance to do this project again, I definitely would for different purposes and audiences.
